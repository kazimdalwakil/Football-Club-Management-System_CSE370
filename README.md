# Football-Club-Management-System
In this project we tried to build a website for the management of a football club. The website has two views, User view and Admin View. Users can buy jerseys, merchandise etc from the club shop. A lot of features are also available such as searching a product, sorting by price etc. Admin of the website can update, add, delete a product from the club shop. 

There are other features too. Such as users can see the board members, details of the players of the club. Board members can login as admin and can inspect the website and can see who is managing which club shop. 

The web-app project was created for the completion of the Database Management System (CSE370) course at BRAC University. The technologies used for building this project are
